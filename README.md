📺 Project Overview 

This project was designed with a screen resolution of 1920 x 1080, 375x667 and 768x1024 in mind, ensuring optimal layout and responsiveness at Full HD. 

It is my first solo project, developed as part of the Full-Stack Developer course at Conquer Blocks. 

The goal was to put into practice the knowledge and skills I’ve acquired so far, including frontend design, responsive layouts, and component structuring.
